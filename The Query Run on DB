0. Making a View of the newest pods and nodes

for pods:

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW podss AS
select  m.*
from pods m 
inner JOIN 
    (SELECT max(added_time) AS max_added_time
       FROM pods) grouptest
on m.added_time = grouptest.max_added_time

for nodes:
 
CREATE or REPLACE VIEW nodess AS
select  m.*
from nodes m 
inner JOIN 
    (SELECT max(added_time) AS max_added_time
       FROM nodes) grouptest
on m.added_time = grouptest.max_added_time
 

1. Making a View of Space & Remaining Space:

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW SPACE_CPU AS
    SELECT
        "host_ip",
	   SUM (rr_cpu) AS total_cpu,
       SUM (rr_memory) AS total_memory
    FROM
	   "podss"
    WHERE phase IN ('Running','Terminating')
    GROUP BY
	   "host_ip";
       
       
       
2. Making a View of All info:

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW eve AS
    SELECT
        "host_ip",
	    total_cpu,
        total_memory,
        attachable_disk,
        cpu,
        memory,
        max_pods,
        hostname,
        internalip,
        volumes_attached,
        voluems_in_use,
        (attachable_disk - volumes_attached) AS volumes_left,
        (cpu - total_cpu) AS CPU_left,
        (memory - total_memory) AS Memory_left
    FROM
	    public."space_cpu", public."nodess"
    WHERE
        host_ip = internalip;
        
3. For the namespace,


CREATE or REPLACE VIEW NS_USE AS
    SELECT
        "namespace",
	   SUM (rr_cpu) AS total_cpu,
       SUM (rr_memory) AS total_memory
    FROM
	   "podss"
    GROUP BY
	   "namespace";
