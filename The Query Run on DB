0. Making a View of the newest pods and nodes
 for pods:
 
CREATE or REPLACE VIEW podss AS
SELECT m.*                    -- get the row that contains the max value
FROM pods m                 -- "m" from "max"
    LEFT JOIN pods b        -- "b" from "bigger"
            -- match "max" row with "bigger" row by `home`
        ON m.added_time< b.added_time            -- want "bigger" than "max"
WHERE b.added_time  IS NULL      -- keep only if there is no bigger than max

 for nodes:
 
CREATE or REPLACE VIEW nodess AS
SELECT m.*                    -- get the row that contains the max value
FROM nodes m                 -- "m" from "max"
    LEFT JOIN nodes b        -- "b" from "bigger"
            -- match "max" row with "bigger" row by `home`
        ON m.added_time< b.added_time            -- want "bigger" than "max"
WHERE b.added_time  IS NULL      -- keep only if there is no bigger than max


1. Making a View of Space & Remaining Space:

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW SPACE_CPU AS
    SELECT
        "host_ip",
	   SUM (rr_cpu) AS total_cpu,
       SUM (rr_memory) AS total_memory
    FROM
	   "podss"
    WHERE phase IN ('Running','Terminating')
    GROUP BY
	   "host_ip";
       
       
       
2. Making a View of All info:

CREATE or REPLACE VIEW eve AS
    SELECT
        "host_ip",
	    total_cpu,
        total_memory,
        attachable_disk,
        cpu,
        memory,
        max_pods,
        hostname,
        internalip,
        volumes_attached,
        voluems_in_use,
        (attachable_disk - volumes_attached) AS volumes_left,
        (cpu - total_cpu) AS CPU_left,
        (memory - total_memory) AS Memory_left
    FROM
	    public."space_cpu", public."nodess"
    WHERE
        host_ip = internalip;
        
3. For the namespace,


CREATE or REPLACE VIEW NS_USE AS
    SELECT
        "namespace",
	   SUM (rr_cpu) AS total_cpu,
       SUM (rr_memory) AS total_memory
    FROM
	   "podss"
    GROUP BY
	   "namespace";
